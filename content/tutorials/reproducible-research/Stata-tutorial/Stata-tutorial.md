In this tutorial, we guide you to learn coding in Stata and its applications.




## Objectives of this tutorial

- Learn to code in Stata following proper coding style guidelines
- Learn to conduct impact evaluation analysis using Stata

## 1. Set up Stata and Learn Style Guidelines
In
[Learn How to Set up Stata](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/stata/), we guide you through necessary steps to set up Stata on your computer.

## 2. Learn Style Guidelines in Stata

[Stata Coding Style Guidelines](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/develop-your-research-skills/tips/stata-code-style/) summarizes the coding styles in Stata.

[Integrating Stata in Automated Workflows](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/automate-and-execute-your-work/automate-your-workflow/stata-error-handling-make/) gives insight how to use R to check for any error in the Stata log files in order to use Stata within an automated research pipeline.

## 3. Data Analysis with stata

[Run a Regression Analysis](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/regression-analysis/) provides an overview of regression analysis in Stata. It also provides information about exporting the regression results.

[Impact evaluation with Difference-in-Differences and Regression Discontinuity](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/impact-evaluation/) guides you through the Impact Evaluation techniques and provides information how to use Stata to apply these techniques.
